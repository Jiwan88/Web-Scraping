I wasn’t interested in school and I knew this was where I could come to learn about what I’m interested in. My Dad has an engineering business so I grew up tinkering with mechanical stuff.”,“I loved making motorbikes at school in engineering, but apart from that school was not my thing. Dad was into metal and motors so I was always interested in what he was doing. My grandmother knew about this course because she works at NorthTec so I decided to give it a go.”,“I wanted to go farming but my Dad suggested it would be better to get a trade first. He is in engineering and I always liked being in his workshop so I thought I’d give it a go. I’m only 16 so I’ve got time on my side.”,“I did a Sport and Recreation Degree and had been working as a personal trainer for four years but I was ready for a change. My Mum was working at Marsden Point Refinery so I got a job there isolating pipelines, tensioning bolts, and doing some Quality Assurance Control during the shutdown.”,“I was signed up to do an engineering degree at Auckland uni but then decided I didn’t want to do four more years of study straight from school. So I took a gap year and did the mechanical engineering six-month NorthTec course instead. It gave me a chance to learn how to use each of the machines and in the process I found I love machining.”","Compulsory Courses,

","The exciting world of architecture will be unveiled for you with this programme which gives you all the skills to work as an architectural technician. You’ll learn the theory of design and construction, and how to work with clients to maximise the success of building projects.,“Since I was a kid I’ve always liked drawing buildings and then through high school I started getting into construction. I was born in Fiji, came to New Zealand in 2011 and finished high school here. I looked at studying architecture in Auckland but my brother and sister had both been to NorthTec so I found out about the course here.”,“I decided to do this course because of the TV show Fixer upper. I’ve studied other things in the 10 years I’ve been living in New Zealand and I’ve been working as a chef, but studying architectural technology means I can get into business flipping houses with my wife.”,“I had been working as a builder but got injured last year so decided it was time to change. By extending into design, I can still draw if I get hurt.”,“By coming here straight from school I’ve put myself in a position where I’m forced to either bend or break. I’m amazed and how fast and intensive my learning is and I’m loving it.”,“One of the key reasons for coming here is the tutors. They are real, they’re knowledgeable and experienced, and they treat us like peers. They really encourage us to push beyond our own limits and to expand enough to take in new learning and experiences. I did Business Admin here last year and enjoyed the vibe and the level of motivation so much that I decided to start on this architectural journey.”,The exciting world of architecture will be unveiled for you with this programme which gives you all the skills to work as an architectural technician.

","“I had been living overseas for a lot of the last 10 years and have always been a massive advocate for New Zealand and our environment. When I came home a year ago, I loved being back and was inspired by the great work happening in Northland. In the process of re-discovering our amazing walks, I came across a lady surveying skinks on the Bream Head track, a summer job she had gained through work experience during this course. She was incredibly enthusiastic about all aspects of the programme and NorthTec, which was the final push I needed to start the enrolment process.”,“If I’d known earlier how good this was, I would have done it sooner. I love being outside and I feel so happy when I'm in the bush knowing I am doing something positive for the environment.”,“I get paid to spend my summer at the beach – and doing work I love. I always knew I wanted to work in conservation but I wasn’t sure about academic study, until I got addicted to it. I graduated with my Masters degree in Conservation Biology in 2016 and I’m now working a six month contract with DOC as seasonal Fairy Tern Ranger at Waipu Cove.”,“The best part of the course was getting out and meeting people in the industry with initiatives like Project Island Song and Landcare groups. I had contact here at Kiwi North with my work placement for my practicum, and the natural fit of my passion and skills led to this part time work when I finished my degree in 2016.”,“I love my job. I see parts of Northland that no-one else goes to, I meet and liaise with a lot of people connected to the land, and I get to work autonomously in the field.”,
,
Ashlee Lawrence works as a Biosecurity Officer for Northland Regional Council, managing the Freshwater Pest programme for the region, as well as working on the biocontrol agent programme, in particular those that will assist with the control of wild ginger in Northland.,
,
Ashlee’s introduction to working in biosecurity came while she was still studying for her diploma.,
,
“In one of our papers we have ‘practicum’ where we volunteer for 80 hours at an environmental agency, so I rang the NRC and asked if they had any work. I was placed with the biosecurity team and allocated two pest plants to track down and eradicate. I was given a health and safety briefing then was sent out with another student with a truck and eradication gear. We had already completed a GrowSafe Certificate as part of our course so could use chemicals and spray equipment. When the 80 hours was up, I asked if I could continue to work as a volunteer and the rest has developed from there.”,
,
Ashlee points to some specifics from her NorthTec training that have given her confidence in her work skills.,
,
“Our course is the best training for conservationists in Northland. It is heavy on academic training with a focus on monitoring skills that are used by every environmental agency and are a benchmark for employers. That skill set sits against a backdrop of the study of New Zealand’s evolutionary history and why we are one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. We have so many special species here that you won’t find anywhere else in the world.”,
,
Another key study subject that Ashley says dovetails with employment is Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which was recently introduced into NorthTec environmental training.,
,
“Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a computer-based mapping system and it is becoming essential to employment in environmental work.”,
,
Ashlee strongly recommends that students who are looking for work allied to their training, volunteer some time. “Approach an employer in your related field and offer your time so they get to see what you are capable of. Things unfold from there.”,
,
“My dream is to someday work as a Biodiversity Asset Ranger in the South Island amongst our richly diverse environments down there."",
	Finding kiwi chicks, ferrying students to the island, building tracks, and measuring geckos are all part of a day’s work for Bernie Buhler. Bernie is the ranger on Limestone Island in Whangarei Harbour and the 93 acre island’s only resident. “This is a dream job for me. I had just graduated from NorthTec when I started here as the ranger in February 2013. I love the conservation work and I love the passion of the people I work with.”,
	,
	But Bernie is relatively new to the world of conservation and wildlife. “I worked as a chef for twenty years, mostly in Whangarei, and was ready for a change. I have always liked the outdoors and looked into study options at NorthTec. Because I was out of the habit of study, I started with a year certificate course in Conservation Management. I surprised myself, did really well, got a scholarship for more study, and so went on to complete the Bachelor of Applied Science majoring in Biodiversity.”,
	,
	Part of Bernie’s third year study project included field trips to Limestone Island so he got to know the then rangers, Ben and Jo Barr. Bernie - “After I finished my degree Ben contacted me because he required the services of a trapper. They later needed someone to island-sit while they went on summer holiday, and then they decided to leave and Ben became a tutor at NorthTec. I was appointed interim ranger and later was selected for the advertised ranger job from 93 applicants.”,
	,
	The variety of Bernie’s island ranger work is a big part of his job’s appeal and he has plenty of physical and social support. “I can be introducing weta to kids, checking the predator traps, then weighing petrel, driving the barge, or helping volunteers build a track. We have a barge that holds 23 people and I bring school groups, retired people, or volunteers over here once or twice a week. We have a well attended volunteers’ day once a month and people are keen to help with making tracks, weeding, baiting traps, or building.”,
	,
	Bernie attributes the NorthTec science degree tutors for turning him on to learning and onto conservation. “We had a week long camp when our course started and we were immersed in learning outdoors. The degree is a tough course but so worthwhile if you can hang in there. It gave me the skills and confidence to get this job.”,
	,
	The Limestone Island Ranger position is now limited to a three year contract. Bernie – “I’m a year into it and loving it. When the time is up though, I’ll probably go on to something bigger and better, like Little Barrier Island, but I’m happy to go anywhere and I know I’ll enjoy whatever comes up.,
	,
	,Find out more about NorthTec's conservation courses,What began for Lyn Wade as a step towards being more informed about conservation, has grown into her recent completion of a degree in Applied Science (Bio-Diversity Management.),
,
Lyn – “I started study in 2007 aiming to do a certificate so I could be better informed in my role as a trustee for Little Barrier Island Supporters’ Trust. I have a fascination and passion for conservation so I looked at part time study options that I could fit around my family commitments and my work as a registered nurse.”,
,
“Even though I live close to Auckland, NorthTec offered the convenience of subjects I could group into two day blocks of part time study compared with an hour here and there through a week. We had small classes and awesome field trips and I got hooked on learning, so I went on to the diploma and then the degree when it became available.”,
,
“I finished my degree in 2014 and I have such a sense of accomplishment. The flexibility of my being able to study at my own pace was also part of the attraction at NorthTec and probably the reason I completed the whole course.”,
,
“I am now Chairperson for Little Barrier Island Supporters Trust, and editing a comprehensive book on Hauturu (alongside Dick Vetich). And, in 2018 I received a QSM for services to conservation in particular for work on Hauturu.”,
,
Lyn chose the subject of streams on Little Barrier Island as her special negotiated study third year project for her degree.,
Lyn - “The Auckland Council has since requested information from my study, and a PhD student completed a paper on the Hauturu streams, which has been accepted for the New Zealand Journal of Zoology.”,
,
Lyn created a poster to present the information from her study and was invited to submit the poster to the Entomological Conference in Queenstown in April this year. “The posters submitted are usually from Masters students so it was an honour to be involved - and my poster received the award for second place. I looked at the special place Little Barrier Island has in NZ conservation and was also able to compare my aquatic survey with a similar study done 50 years ago."",
,
“I’m now in my 60s and I want to encourage and inspire older woman to study. I feel a lot of women don’t realise they can go back and study and how exciting it is to follow your passion. My daughter is in her 40s and is has followed my lead, graduating from her degree and is now teaching Science at college level.”,After successfully completing the ,Diploma in Environmental Management (Level 6), at NorthTec, you can study for this degree in your third year. You will gain comprehensive knowledge of regional, national and global challenges to biodiversity management. Enjoy small classes, plenty of field trips and a friendly atmosphere.","Compulsory Courses,

I am from Russia and my sister and I researched study options before I moved here, and we found that NorthTec was a good technical school. I then moved here, studied English to level 4, and I started my civil engineering training.”,“I’m working full time as a project manager and price estimator for Robinsons Asphalt and they are supporting me to study part time here for my diploma. I became interested in engineering when I was working for an engineering company in post-earthquake Christchurch for a few years.”,“With all the new building and roading development in our region, now seemed a good time to step into civil engineering. Previously sport was my main driver and I did fill-in jobs to support it. I was helping run the Aquatic Centre before enrolling for this course.”,“I’ve been working in structural engineering for four years and was keen to study sooner but work and family commitments meant I had to put it on hold. As soon as the circumstances changed and I returned to the north from Tauranga, I researched study options and found doing this course for two years full time was the best choice.”,“I was offered a job as a contractor before I left school. After about a month in, my work colleague suggested I sign up for this course and I was on board the next semester. I was contracting for two years then I got offered a job by a consulting engineer.”,“My whole life has opened up to possibilities I never knew existed before.” John has landed a specialist job inspecting structures with KiwiRail. “I got this job inspecting bridges, tunnels, and culverts for the whole Auckland area as soon as I finished my Diploma in Civil Engineering.”,“I was already studying in the civil engineering field back in India when I decided to go overseas and continue my studies. I chose New Zealand and NorthTec on the recommendation of a friend. I studied full-time for two years and completed my NZDE Civil (New Zealand Diploma in Civil Engineering) at the end of 2016. In the last year of my study, NorthTec helped me get a job in a local civil engineering consultancy firm where I began my engineering career.”,
,
“I now work full time as an Intermediate Projects Engineer with the Whangarei District Council. My main interest has always been in highways and traffic engineering so I chose to specialise in roading in my Diploma.”,
,
“The NorthTec Diploma is really relevant to my work here, especially the content on traffic, highways, geotechnical and structural engineering. As part of my diploma I was also required to study Engineering Management which emphasises the basis of a contract between the client (local government in my case) and the contractor. It also helps in understanding the day to day problems faced in managing a project and how to solve these problems professionally.”,
“All the tutors at NorthTec are very experienced and most of them teach part-time at NorthTec while still working full time in the civil engineering industry. This ensures that the course content stays current and relevant, and helps students gain local knowledge.”,
,
“I’ve now decided do my Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering by correspondence with the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand (accredited by University of Southern Queensland, Australia). I also did a couple of bridging courses in addition to my Diploma at NorthTec last year. USQ and Open Poly have recognised my diploma and the bridging papers and they have cross credited around half of my degree on this basis. Most engineering employers, including my current employer, are very supportive and they often grant scholarships to their employees for relevant training as part of their professional development - which I really like.”,
,
“I’ve learnt a lot by implementing our NorthTec course content since I started working in this industry. It has contributed to both my personal and professional development especially in the areas of engineering, project management and building relations with various stakeholders.”,
,
“I still continue to learn a lot every day and my long-term plan is become a successful Chartered Professional Engineer (CPEng).”,“I started work as a traffic controller (‘stop-go lollipop person’) and labourer with United Civil Construction 10 years ago, and I’m now the Project Manager for their Dargaville Sewer Pump Station and Rising Main Upgrade. I’m from Te Hapua so my first three years with the company were on the Cape Reinga seal extension project.”,
,
“The company then brought me down to the Kamo bypass project to work as the Site Traffic Management Supervisor (STMS) where I worked closely with the Project Managers and Contract Manager. Our Contract Manager at the time asked if I was interested in studying civil engineering and when I said yes, he put me forward to be vetted by the Managing Director of United Civil Construction for supported study. A year later I started my Diploma in Civil Engineering part time while still working full time for United Civil Construction.”,
,
“I felt a bit out of my league when I first started as I hadn’t done any study for the previous 10 years but I got a huge amount of support from my tutors and work colleagues. I would email these guys at all hours and they were happy to help where possible. A lot of what I learnt in class, I was able to put into practice. After four years of study I graduated in 2017.”,
,
“My specialist topic was waste-water so I can now directly apply that knowledge to my current job up in Kerikeri. I work closely with the Project Manager, Greg. He’s teaching me some of the contractual aspects of the project as well as certain engineering aspects that were picked up during his years of experience. I’m amazed at my own growth, especially at how much information I’ve now absorbed.,
,
“I’m hoping my 10-year journey from labourer to Project Manager sets an example to not only the other guys in our company, but also to the whānau back home, that anything is possible. I feel so lucky to have the support of the company and my work colleagues, even going to the extent of attending my graduation. It felt like an achievement for everyone and helps us all see what’s possible.”,This diploma will provide you with the knowledge and skills required of an engineering technician. You’ll learn to apply theoretical and technical knowledge to practical situations and demonstrate the necessary strategies to work safely and effectively with contractors, communities, clients and authorities.","Compulsory Courses,

","If you want to work alongside people and whānau across the health and wellbeing sectors, including mental health and addiction support work, this programme is for you. You’ll learn all the tools and strategies to foster hope, support recovery and build resilience in individuals and families.,“I believe that because I’ve experienced addiction, I can utilize the talents I’ve been blessed with to support others to move forward.”,“A passion for health and well-being has replaced my substance addictions. My progress has come from a pathway of self-discovery that I hope to pass on to others.”,“Mum is a social worker so I know how much need there is for support workers up here. One of our whānau has also been in and out of prison for years and in supporting him, I see lots of others without support.”,“When the nursing application form asked why I wanted to be a nurse, I realized that I didn’t. I had done level 4 foundation to get into study and prior to that was choosing between social services and art. A lot has been going on for me in recent years including some hard relationships, so that cemented the decision to get into social services and start with the mental health and addictions course.” ,“Since studying in this area, I'm developing even more of a deep passion for helping those people out there who are struggling with addiction and mental illnesses. I know first-hand what it's like as I have been a sufferer in the past. For many years I battled alcoholism, addiction and multiple mental illnesses.”,“I’m a recovering addict and alcoholic from six years ago, so it is fitting for me to help others by passing it forward. I’m from Auckland and I moved up here to start a fresh life. NorthTec and this course happened to be here and I’ve just finished level 4.”,Since graduating Krizia has moved into work at Waikato District Health Board with an acute mental health service ward for older persons. She has also completed a Postgraduate Certificate, Diploma and a Master of Nursing at the University of Auckland, graduating in May 2019.,
 ,
“Studying cognitive behavioural therapy at NorthTec has helped me a lot in terms of my work as a mental health nurse, and with my postgraduate studies. I am more therapeutic and empathetic as a result of this training, and able to establish a good rapport with my clients.”,
 ,
“I am currently a certified mental health supervisor for mental health nurses where I applied my cognitive behavioural therapy skills, which I learned from Northtec.”,
 ,
Krizia was a qualified nurse in the Philippines and needed to study to become certified in New Zealand. “I was more into mental health in the Philippines so I decided on this six-month Certificate in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. The certificate gave me an added skill for my profession and enabled me to nurse here, and specialise in mental health.”,
 ,
“We studied the thoughts, emotions, behaviour, and physiological responses of people and how they interlink. We also learn how to handle our own stresses, deal with anxiety and depression, relate to people, and pursue personal and professional development.”,
 ,
“The basis of the content is that you are your own therapist and we encourage clients to solve their own problems utilizing CBT techniques. I can apply this to my future nursing patients as well as to family and friends.”,
 ,
“The NorthTec International Committee went that extra mile to help us with anything. Whangarei is peaceful, clean, and close to nature, and the students were really supportive.,
 ,
“Thank you NorthTec!”,If you want to work alongside people and whānau across the health and wellbeing sectors, including mental health and addiction support work, this programme is for you.

We got some experience here first stripping down and painting some old church pews, and we had to organise the business side of the town job sorting out things like the scaffolding and pricing, but we mostly learn by doing.”,“Painting is really satisfying.

There’s a lot more to rolling than I thought – especially rolling a ceiling.”,“We’re painting our town. Really. I love seeing the houses go from pretty run down to really nice.

","“I was a mechanical engineer for 12 years running and programming machines but when the industry started to slow down it was time for a change of career for me. Friends suggested I get into cooking and now that I’m into it, I realize engineering and cooking oddly have a skill set in common. You’re controlling heat, working with different steels, need good hand-eye co-ordination, and you have to keep your tools sharp.”,“I’ve always had a passion for food because my Mum was a good cook and my Grandad had a café in Malaysia. I’ve also prepared food for our church since I came to New Zealand 10 years ago, and I have a cup cake stall at the market in Dargaville. I have two kids and I thought it may be too late for me to study, but as soon as I saw the pamphlet for this course everything fell into place.”,“Every day after school as a child, I would watch Mum making food, then as an adult I was working in food technology in China. I wanted to change from checking on food, to learning how to cook it. I have a family member and a friend here and they helped me check out courses. Auckland was too big and I wanted be in a quiet town so I chose NorthTec.”,“I love the people here. Anyone who is into hospitality is a certain sort of weird that I really enjoy. It’s part of who we are. I was going to get into hairdressing but I realized I love cooking more. I also realized that within hospitality I prefer back-of-the-house.”,“I was choosing between studying cookery or social work and actually, cookery chose me. I looked into this programme, read student profiles and realised cookery was second nature to me.”,“I adore food – and I love learning how it’s made so other people can enjoy the best of it too. Having done level 4, I’m back now to get the diploma because it will give me more opportunities for work and a better life for my growing family.”,“I have a massive passion for food and I love the constantly pumping hospitality industry with its long days meeting different people.”,“I’ve been working here in hospitality since I was 15 years old and had no interest in being a chef until a young passionate chef inspired me as to what is possible. I then started studying, first at level three and then to my level 5 Diploma.”,

I’m liking all of it but especially the practical experience we get on the course and learning all the aspects of safety.”,With a family background in electrical engineering, Zander had already started studying in that field in South Africa. “Dad then came here to New Zealand so I gave up my study there and we started researching places here where I could continue studying. I was able to cross-credit the basic levels here and signed up as an international student. It’s expensive but worth it.”,“I knew I wanted to get qualified in a trade. I had done a lot of things previously like nursing, beauty therapy, massage and café work, but realized a trade would give me a stable income as well as the opportunity to work at something I was good at and would enjoy. I chose Electrical Engineering but knew nothing about it when I started. I’m very passionate about it now and hope to do it forever.”,

","An essential introduction to professional cookery, this programme will prepare you to work as a junior chef in a commercial kitchen. You’ll learn how to prepare, cook and present a range of basic dishes, while learning about health and safety, food safety and security practices.,“I was a mechanical engineer for 12 years running and programming machines but when the industry started to slow down it was time for a change of career for me. Friends suggested I get into cooking and now that I’m into it, I realize engineering and cooking oddly have a skill set in common. You’re controlling heat, working with different steels, need good hand-eye co-ordination, and you have to keep your tools sharp.”,“I’ve always had a passion for food because my Mum was a good cook and my Grandad had a café in Malaysia. I’ve also prepared food for our church since I came to New Zealand 10 years ago, and I have a cup cake stall at the market in Dargaville. I have two kids and I thought it may be too late for me to study, but as soon as I saw the pamphlet for this course everything fell into place.”,“Every day after school as a child, I would watch Mum making food, then as an adult I was working in food technology in China. I wanted to change from checking on food, to learning how to cook it. I have a family member and a friend here and they helped me check out courses. Auckland was too big and I wanted be in a quiet town so I chose NorthTec.”,“I love the people here. Anyone who is into hospitality is a certain sort of weird that I really enjoy. It’s part of who we are. I was going to get into hairdressing but I realized I love cooking more. I also realized that within hospitality I prefer back-of-the-house.”,“I was choosing between studying cookery or social work and actually, cookery chose me. I looked into this programme, read student profiles and realised cookery was second nature to me.”,“I adore food – and I love learning how it’s made so other people can enjoy the best of it too. Having done level 4, I’m back now to get the diploma because it will give me more opportunities for work and a better life for my growing family.”,“I have a massive passion for food and I love the constantly pumping hospitality industry with its long days meeting different people.”,“I’ve been working here in hospitality since I was 15 years old and had no interest in being a chef until a young passionate chef inspired me as to what is possible. I then started studying, first at level three and then to my level 5 Diploma.”,
,
“During my training I particularly loved working with the international students and being exposed to different foods and skills. I was working six days a week in Dargaville all the time I was studying in Whangarei because I didn’t want a student loan, so time management was a real discipline. I finished in late 2016.”,
,
“I am now working at the Coasana Restaurant in Te Awamutu. My boss here has taught me a lot about different foods and I feel that I am constantly upgrading my skills.”,
,
“I would love to work in a bigger place with more chefs so I can continue to learn on the job and be exposed to food and experiences that are new to me.”,“I’m working as Demi-Chef de Partie at The Quay in the Town Basin. It is in Cuisine Magazine’s top 100 New Zealand restaurants and one of only two in Northland on that list. It is number one in desserts – and I love making desserts. My tutor told me about this place and I started as a kitchen hand for a month when I was still studying. In that time I was also helping the chefs with prep work, and then I was offered full time work as Commis Chef once I finished my study.”,An essential introduction to professional cookery, this programme will prepare you to work as a junior chef in a commercial kitchen.

","If you like the sound of being in charge of large vehicles, start the wheels turning with NorthTec’s commercial transport training. Commercial transport covers all sorts of vehicles from light and heavy trucks to buses and forklifts.,“I blew my back out in forestry so I had to change industry and upskill. I looked into commercial transport options because I had driven trucks before but didn’t have the licences. This course has given me the tickets and is close to where I live in town.”,“I’ve always liked driving and I’ve driven a lot of things but not big trucks. I joined this course to get a Dangerous Goods licence for courier driving and now I realise other licences we are receiving are opening more options.”,“Doing this course gives my life direction and meaning. Before this I had work but I had no tickets, no goals, and my life was going nowhere. I was working on a farm in the weather and the mud and driving the school bus, but I’ve always wanted to drive logging trucks and do long hauls.”,“I’m a qualified welder and was working fulltime making trailers when my work was reduced to part time. I heard on National Radio that there was a shortage of drivers and I’m used to working with engines and steel so I decided to come back NorthTec and do the transport course. I had previously done an engineering course here and I like the environment.”,
	“I did the road transport course to further my business. I harvest and prune avocados on contract with my own cherry picker and this gives me a back-up if we hit a bad season. It also gives me entry points into other industries because we get tickets in operating fork lifts, wheel tracks and rollers, and handling dangerous goods, as well as trucking and bus driving. Other trucking courses didn’t have the variety or the value that the NorthTec course has.”,
	 ,
	Holly has been able to do the course around her work. “I have especially enjoyed jumping on the digger and driving the truck but I was terrified driving the bus because of its size and blind spots. Luckily there’s not much theory but we cover enough to learn the importance of things like keeping up-to-date log books to avoid big fines.”,
	 ,
	“Tackling the challenges has built up my confidence to actually do things. I bought a wide trailer that I had to drive through Auckland and over the harbour bridge. There was only just enough space, but I did it, partly because of the confidence from the course and the tutors.”,
	 ,
	Holly wasn’t interested in trucking until the last few years. “My Mum is a dairy farmer and my Dad is a trucker, but I only got interested in trucking after I went out and bought a cherry picker. It’s not considered a woman thing and I got shut down a few times, but business took off so that boosted my confidence.”,
	 ,
	“The course has opened the doors for the possibility of expanding my business and offering more services to my customers.”,

 New Zealand Diploma in Environmental Management (Level 6) with a strand in Terrestrial 

","Take the next step in investigating terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems while learning about the challenges to our unique environment. Complete a work placement to start putting your new skills into action, and develop your networks in the conservation field. You’ll learn all about biodiversity and resource management, as well as monitoring and evaluating ecosystem dynamics. You’ll also be able to apply legislative requirements when conducting environmental activities. You will design and coordinate environmental projects involving monitoring, analysis and reporting.,“I had been living overseas for a lot of the last 10 years and have always been a massive advocate for New Zealand and our environment. When I came home a year ago, I loved being back and was inspired by the great work happening in Northland. In the process of re-discovering our amazing walks, I came across a lady surveying skinks on the Bream Head track, a summer job she had gained through work experience during this course. She was incredibly enthusiastic about all aspects of the programme and NorthTec, which was the final push I needed to start the enrolment process.”,“If I’d known earlier how good this was, I would have done it sooner. I love being outside and I feel so happy when I'm in the bush knowing I am doing something positive for the environment.”,“I get paid to spend my summer at the beach – and doing work I love. I always knew I wanted to work in conservation but I wasn’t sure about academic study, until I got addicted to it. I graduated with my Masters degree in Conservation Biology in 2016 and I’m now working a six month contract with DOC as seasonal Fairy Tern Ranger at Waipu Cove.”,“The best part of the course was getting out and meeting people in the industry with initiatives like Project Island Song and Landcare groups. I had contact here at Kiwi North with my work placement for my practicum, and the natural fit of my passion and skills led to this part time work when I finished my degree in 2016.”,“I love my job. I see parts of Northland that no-one else goes to, I meet and liaise with a lot of people connected to the land, and I get to work autonomously in the field.”,
,
Ashlee Lawrence works as a Biosecurity Officer for Northland Regional Council, managing the Freshwater Pest programme for the region, as well as working on the biocontrol agent programme, in particular those that will assist with the control of wild ginger in Northland.,
,
Ashlee’s introduction to working in biosecurity came while she was still studying for her diploma.,
,
“In one of our papers we have ‘practicum’ where we volunteer for 80 hours at an environmental agency, so I rang the NRC and asked if they had any work. I was placed with the biosecurity team and allocated two pest plants to track down and eradicate. I was given a health and safety briefing then was sent out with another student with a truck and eradication gear. We had already completed a GrowSafe Certificate as part of our course so could use chemicals and spray equipment. When the 80 hours was up, I asked if I could continue to work as a volunteer and the rest has developed from there.”,
,
Ashlee points to some specifics from her NorthTec training that have given her confidence in her work skills.,
,
“Our course is the best training for conservationists in Northland. It is heavy on academic training with a focus on monitoring skills that are used by every environmental agency and are a benchmark for employers. That skill set sits against a backdrop of the study of New Zealand’s evolutionary history and why we are one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. We have so many special species here that you won’t find anywhere else in the world.”,
,
Another key study subject that Ashley says dovetails with employment is Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which was recently introduced into NorthTec environmental training.,
,
“Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a computer-based mapping system and it is becoming essential to employment in environmental work.”,
,
Ashlee strongly recommends that students who are looking for work allied to their training, volunteer some time. “Approach an employer in your related field and offer your time so they get to see what you are capable of. Things unfold from there.”,
,
“My dream is to someday work as a Biodiversity Asset Ranger in the South Island amongst our richly diverse environments down there."",
	Finding kiwi chicks, ferrying students to the island, building tracks, and measuring geckos are all part of a day’s work for Bernie Buhler. Bernie is the ranger on Limestone Island in Whangarei Harbour and the 93 acre island’s only resident. “This is a dream job for me. I had just graduated from NorthTec when I started here as the ranger in February 2013. I love the conservation work and I love the passion of the people I work with.”,
	,
	But Bernie is relatively new to the world of conservation and wildlife. “I worked as a chef for twenty years, mostly in Whangarei, and was ready for a change. I have always liked the outdoors and looked into study options at NorthTec. Because I was out of the habit of study, I started with a year certificate course in Conservation Management. I surprised myself, did really well, got a scholarship for more study, and so went on to complete the Bachelor of Applied Science majoring in Biodiversity.”,
	,
	Part of Bernie’s third year study project included field trips to Limestone Island so he got to know the then rangers, Ben and Jo Barr. Bernie - “After I finished my degree Ben contacted me because he required the services of a trapper. They later needed someone to island-sit while they went on summer holiday, and then they decided to leave and Ben became a tutor at NorthTec. I was appointed interim ranger and later was selected for the advertised ranger job from 93 applicants.”,
	,
	The variety of Bernie’s island ranger work is a big part of his job’s appeal and he has plenty of physical and social support. “I can be introducing weta to kids, checking the predator traps, then weighing petrel, driving the barge, or helping volunteers build a track. We have a barge that holds 23 people and I bring school groups, retired people, or volunteers over here once or twice a week. We have a well attended volunteers’ day once a month and people are keen to help with making tracks, weeding, baiting traps, or building.”,
	,
	Bernie attributes the NorthTec science degree tutors for turning him on to learning and onto conservation. “We had a week long camp when our course started and we were immersed in learning outdoors. The degree is a tough course but so worthwhile if you can hang in there. It gave me the skills and confidence to get this job.”,
	,
	The Limestone Island Ranger position is now limited to a three year contract. Bernie – “I’m a year into it and loving it. When the time is up though, I’ll probably go on to something bigger and better, like Little Barrier Island, but I’m happy to go anywhere and I know I’ll enjoy whatever comes up.,
	,
	,Find out more about NorthTec's conservation courses,What began for Lyn Wade as a step towards being more informed about conservation, has grown into her recent completion of a degree in Applied Science (Bio-Diversity Management.),
,
Lyn – “I started study in 2007 aiming to do a certificate so I could be better informed in my role as a trustee for Little Barrier Island Supporters’ Trust. I have a fascination and passion for conservation so I looked at part time study options that I could fit around my family commitments and my work as a registered nurse.”,
,
“Even though I live close to Auckland, NorthTec offered the convenience of subjects I could group into two day blocks of part time study compared with an hour here and there through a week. We had small classes and awesome field trips and I got hooked on learning, so I went on to the diploma and then the degree when it became available.”,
,
“I finished my degree in 2014 and I have such a sense of accomplishment. The flexibility of my being able to study at my own pace was also part of the attraction at NorthTec and probably the reason I completed the whole course.”,
,
“I am now Chairperson for Little Barrier Island Supporters Trust, and editing a comprehensive book on Hauturu (alongside Dick Vetich). And, in 2018 I received a QSM for services to conservation in particular for work on Hauturu.”,
,
Lyn chose the subject of streams on Little Barrier Island as her special negotiated study third year project for her degree.,
Lyn - “The Auckland Council has since requested information from my study, and a PhD student completed a paper on the Hauturu streams, which has been accepted for the New Zealand Journal of Zoology.”,
,
Lyn created a poster to present the information from her study and was invited to submit the poster to the Entomological Conference in Queenstown in April this year. “The posters submitted are usually from Masters students so it was an honour to be involved - and my poster received the award for second place. I looked at the special place Little Barrier Island has in NZ conservation and was also able to compare my aquatic survey with a similar study done 50 years ago."",
,
“I’m now in my 60s and I want to encourage and inspire older woman to study. I feel a lot of women don’t realise they can go back and study and how exciting it is to follow your passion. My daughter is in her 40s and is has followed my lead, graduating from her degree and is now teaching Science at college level.”,Take the next step in investigating terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems while learning about the challenges to our unique environment.

I moved up here from Auckland where I was doing furniture removal and landscaping but my wife now works on a dairy farm so the motivation is there.”,“This feels like real learning on the job. We’re getting work experience here on the farm as we learn new things and I love everything about it – especially that I get to have my own working dog.”,“I’ve come on board this course because my mother doesn't want me to own a tractor until I know how to drive it safely, plus I want to start working on a dairy farm and want to be able to drive the machinery there safely as well. I also want to upskill in farming in general. I grew up on a sheep and beef farm owned by my grandfather and I’m ready to learn more now than just the labouring side of it.”,“I left school and was looking online for agriculture training because it was one of my interests. When I saw this course I wanted to give it a go so I came to the interview and started the next week. I commute from Kerikeri to Kaikohe four days a week and I love it.”,“I’ve re-found my love of learning here. I always did well at school until year 12 when the system changed and I found the class pace too slow and the environment too noisy, so I turned off learning. I did the basics to pass but missed some things I needed.”,“I was brought up in the country so when I found out about this course I was keen to jump on. When I did level 2 which was really practical, the tutor asked me if I wanted to continue to level 3.”,“I love being outdoors every day and learning by doing.

Bernie is the ranger on Limestone Island in Whangarei Harbour and the 93 acre island’s only resident. “This is a dream job for me. I had just graduated from NorthTec when I started here as the ranger in February 2013. I love the conservation work and I love the passion of the people I work with.”,
	,
	But Bernie is relatively new to the world of conservation and wildlife. “I worked as a chef for twenty years, mostly in Whangarei, and was ready for a change. I have always liked the outdoors and looked into study options at NorthTec. Because I was out of the habit of study, I started with a year certificate course in Conservation Management. I surprised myself, did really well, got a scholarship for more study, and so went on to complete the Bachelor of Applied Science majoring in Biodiversity.”,
	,
	Part of Bernie’s third year study project included field trips to Limestone Island so he got to know the then rangers, Ben and Jo Barr. Bernie - “After I finished my degree Ben contacted me because he required the services of a trapper. They later needed someone to island-sit while they went on summer holiday, and then they decided to leave and Ben became a tutor at NorthTec. I was appointed interim ranger and later was selected for the advertised ranger job from 93 applicants.”,
	,
	The variety of Bernie’s island ranger work is a big part of his job’s appeal and he has plenty of physical and social support. “I can be introducing weta to kids, checking the predator traps, then weighing petrel, driving the barge, or helping volunteers build a track. We have a barge that holds 23 people and I bring school groups, retired people, or volunteers over here once or twice a week. We have a well attended volunteers’ day once a month and people are keen to help with making tracks, weeding, baiting traps, or building.”,
	,
	Bernie attributes the NorthTec science degree tutors for turning him on to learning and onto conservation. “We had a week long camp when our course started and we were immersed in learning outdoors. The degree is a tough course but so worthwhile if you can hang in there. It gave me the skills and confidence to get this job.”,
	,
	The Limestone Island Ranger position is now limited to a three year contract. Bernie – “I’m a year into it and loving it. When the time is up though, I’ll probably go on to something bigger and better, like Little Barrier Island, but I’m happy to go anywhere and I know I’ll enjoy whatever comes up.,
	,
	,Find out more about NorthTec's conservation courses,What began for Lyn Wade as a step towards being more informed about conservation, has grown into her recent completion of a degree in Applied Science (Bio-Diversity Management.),
,
Lyn – “I started study in 2007 aiming to do a certificate so I could be better informed in my role as a trustee for Little Barrier Island Supporters’ Trust. I have a fascination and passion for conservation so I looked at part time study options that I could fit around my family commitments and my work as a registered nurse.”,
,
“Even though I live close to Auckland, NorthTec offered the convenience of subjects I could group into two day blocks of part time study compared with an hour here and there through a week. We had small classes and awesome field trips and I got hooked on learning, so I went on to the diploma and then the degree when it became available.”,
,
“I finished my degree in 2014 and I have such a sense of accomplishment. The flexibility of my being able to study at my own pace was also part of the attraction at NorthTec and probably the reason I completed the whole course.”,
,
“I am now Chairperson for Little Barrier Island Supporters Trust, and editing a comprehensive book on Hauturu (alongside Dick Vetich). And, in 2018 I received a QSM for services to conservation in particular for work on Hauturu.”,
,
Lyn chose the subject of streams on Little Barrier Island as her special negotiated study third year project for her degree.,
Lyn - “The Auckland Council has since requested information from my study, and a PhD student completed a paper on the Hauturu streams, which has been accepted for the New Zealand Journal of Zoology.”,
,
Lyn created a poster to present the information from her study and was invited to submit the poster to the Entomological Conference in Queenstown in April this year. “The posters submitted are usually from Masters students so it was an honour to be involved - and my poster received the award for second place. I looked at the special place Little Barrier Island has in NZ conservation and was also able to compare my aquatic survey with a similar study done 50 years ago."",
,
“I’m now in my 60s and I want to encourage and inspire older woman to study. I feel a lot of women don’t realise they can go back and study and how exciting it is to follow your passion. My daughter is in her 40s and is has followed my lead, graduating from her degree and is now teaching Science at college level.”,For lovers of the outdoors and New Zealand’s environment, this programme introduces you to a range of ecosystems from forests to urban habitats. You’ll learn from passionate and inspiring tutors who will encourage you to develop your practical and theoretical knowledge. Learn about our amazing wildlife and our fascinating environment, and find out why it is in danger and what we can do to help. Share the journey with the inspiring team of experts from NorthTec and be informed. This diploma will help you develop the theoretical and practical skills to work within the environmental sector.","Courses,

I turned 30 and decided it was time to move home to Whangarei and start afresh doing something that I wanted and living a more sustainable lifestyle. When both my parents got sick, it tipped the balance and the journey since then to sell up and move has happened fast. My rent is now a quarter of what it was and my outgoings are tiny.”,“This course is giving us access to so many resources like seeds, plant material, potting mix and the use of the facilities. My partner and I are developing family land and we’re keen on living and promoting food sovereignty and sustainability.”,“I’m retired now and help look after the Papa Kainga garden up the road from the marae so it’s great to be learning more about plants and sustainable ways of taking care of them. It’s really different being back in a learning environment but I’m loving it and the students and tutors are fantastic. I find the botanical names are still a challenge but that’s good for me.”,“Being able to see the produce you’ve grown, taste the flavour, and be part of living in a sustainable way is what I’m here for. I was working in the trucking industry for many years but it was time to come home to the land here.”,“This is a fast paced course with lots of different aspects ranging from growing, to irrigation systems, to grafting and propagation. I now have a house on half an acre and two children to support after a marriage break-up, so I’m hoping it will give me ideas for my future.”,“I was working in hot-houses with palms in Auckland then moved up here and have been working in hot-houses and gardens. I already have the CV and the references but it’s time now to get the ticket to validate the experience and open more opportunities.”,“I finished my level 4 horticulture course a few years ago after we had bought a lifestyle block in the Far North and wanted to get into horticulture. I had since drifted back into office work but I was keen to return to horticulture. A friend who knew the manager at Lynwood Avocado Nursery suggested I make enquiries there. The avocado industry is in a huge growth phase, and Lynwood propagate avocado plants so they were looking for staff.”,

When both my parents got sick, it tipped the balance and the journey since then to sell up and move has happened fast. My rent is now a quarter of what it was and my outgoings are tiny.”,“I’m retired now and help look after the Papa Kainga garden up the road from the marae so it’s great to be learning more about plants and sustainable ways of taking care of them. It’s really different being back in a learning environment but I’m loving it and the students and tutors are fantastic. I find the botanical names are still a challenge but that’s good for me.”,“Being able to see the produce you’ve grown, taste the flavour, and be part of living in a sustainable way is what I’m here for. I was working in the trucking industry for many years but it was time to come home to the land here.”,“This is a fast paced course with lots of different aspects ranging from growing, to irrigation systems, to grafting and propagation. I now have a house on half an acre and two children to support after a marriage break-up, so I’m hoping it will give me ideas for my future.”,“I was working in hot-houses with palms in Auckland then moved up here and have been working in hot-houses and gardens. I already have the CV and the references but it’s time now to get the ticket to validate the experience and open more opportunities.”,“I finished my level 4 horticulture course a few years ago after we had bought a lifestyle block in the Far North and wanted to get into horticulture. I had since drifted back into office work but I was keen to return to horticulture. A friend who knew the manager at Lynwood Avocado Nursery suggested I make enquiries there. The avocado industry is in a huge growth phase, and Lynwood propagate avocado plants so they were looking for staff.”,
	From working voluntarily a few hours a week at Tahi Estate, to being employed full time as Honey Operations Manager for their honey business, is sweet success for Knox Henderson. Knox – “A lot has happened in just three years since finishing my horticulture level 4 at NorthTec.”,Learn industry-relevant theories of plant and soils science, growing systems and environments, which underpin practical capabilities in a range of horticulture sectors. You’ll learn workplace health and safety, soil and plant properties, developing organic and/or nursery production, safe and proper chemical and fertiliser use, and landscaping.",,,

 Workforce Restrictions for Children's Workforce","You’ll be in high demand with NorthTec’s unique and comprehensive Bachelor of Nursing. Learn the clinical and interpersonal skills to work in a range of healthcare settings, from hospitals to community-based organisations. You will complete clinical placements here in Northland, and learn through a blend of classroom and online study, preparing you to become a Registered Nurse with the Nursing Council of NZ.,“I was working at a special needs school as a teacher aide and that inspired me to go further. My Mum is a nurse so I was aware of that field and I am keen to do something worthwhile.”,“I like people and building relationships so I worked in retail, but the management positions there in a front of a computer all day are not for me. I want a career and I’m really impacted by the horrendous level of poverty of some of our children. Nursing is a practical way that I can begin to help.”,“I had a few interactions with the health profession as a young mother of two. Some of those were positive and some were negative, but there was one nurse who was really supportive to me at a time that mattered, and that had a lot of impact on me. I knew then that I wanted to help people when they felt vulnerable.”,“Getting my nursing degree has given me so many career options for the future. I’m working in a medical ward at the hospital now and am building the base for my next 30 years for work and for family.”,Laura was in hospital as a patient herself when she realised nursing was what she would love to devote her life to. “During the hospital visits I noticed all the different ways I was treated, so I knew I could help give people a good patient care experience.”,“I’m a different person with regards to my confidence, skills and self-esteem since I’ve done my nursing training and started working in the hospital 18 months ago. I love it and am amazed at my progress and at what I can offer.”,“I was motivated to train as a nurse when my Poppa got sick and I watched my Nana struggling to be his care-giver. I wanted to understand how to best support her. Sadly she later got unwell too and my Poppa is now in a rest home.”,“My first experience of nurses was a bad one. My brother broke his neck when he was 15 and the way the nurse treated him and our family made things really hard for my parents and my brother at a time when we were all very vulnerable.”,“Throughout high school I was involved with dance and performing arts however I decided that I wanted a stable and long term career and Nursing had always appealed to me. I finished my Bachelor of Nursing through NorthTec in 2014 and currently work as a Specialty Clinical Nurse in Youth Health for the Northland District Health Board.”,
,
""My time at NorthTec was probably the most enjoyable three years of my life. Even though we were often faced with serious situations, I loved going into the hospital or communities and being able to offer care whilst being surrounded by supportive tutors, preceptors and classmates. The tutors helped many of us through personal crises which made it obvious that they really care about our wellbeing.”,
,
“The practical component of the course really prepares you for work. From day one we were in the hospital environment making beds and taking blood pressures, then later in rest homes, communities or specialist areas. The theory is equally relevant and prepares you for further postgraduate study.”,
,
“In my second year I had placements in a busy medical ward, and in the community with a public health nurse. Then in my third year, I was placed in the Emergency Department in Whangarei. Although at first apprehensive, I really enjoyed my placement there and was fortunate enough to work there during my new graduate year.”,
,
“I have always had a passion for working with youth and I am so pleased to have this amazing opportunity. I work at various secondary schools around the Whangarei and Kaipara area running self-referral clinics and undertaking health assessments. I certainly deal with a whole range of challenges but I love my job and feel extremely satisfied and rewarded at the end of every day.”,
,
“I love the work and continue to gain confidence and knowledge. The first time I realised how much I have learned was when I had my first NorthTec student to train. I have since been a preceptor for five NorthTec students and have noticed that they all show great initiative, have practical skills and are keen to work and learn."",
,
“I’m keen to continue my own learning and I have completed my postgraduate certificate in Advanced Nursing. From here, I’ll see what unfolds.”,“I am from a medical family, with my dad a nurse specialist, and my mum a podiatrist, and they have both empowered me and inspired me to chase my calling of nursing.”,
	Lennaa Saunders loves learning and loves Northland. “I have just graduated as a registered nurse and have already enrolled into a graduate programme to support my work at Whangarei Hospital.”,
	,
	Lennaa has been accepted for the NETP programme which is a 12 month support programme within the DHB. “Every DHB has a NETP co-ordinator and has a number of positions to fill with new grads each year. I applied through ACE and Northland DHB look favourably on NorthTec trained nurses. You have to stand out in some way regarding wanting to work in your region.”,
	,
	For Lennaa, wanting to work in Northland was a given. “I’m a born and raised Northlander and wanted to stay here to give back to our region and contribute to making Northlanders healthier.”,
	,
	Lennaa has a 12 month contract for a .8 fixed term position as a nurse on Ward 16, a general medical ward at Whangarei hospital. “I applied to this ward after working there for my 10 week elective placement in my last term of training. I love it because, as a generic medical ward, there is so much variety making it a brilliant learning environment. Not one day is the same. There is a great team of people working here in an incredibly supportive culture.”,
	,
	Being part of NETP adds even more support to Lennaa’s first year working as a nurse. “This programme offers you structured support and a preceptor, so there is always someone to talk things over with. The DHB know that we new graduates need support in order to continue to build our skill levels. This supportive environment is important to retain confident, skilled new graduate nurses who are the future work force.”,
	,
	As part of the NETP programme, Lennaa is also sitting a post graduate paper through Auckland University. “This goes towards my Post Graduate Certificate in Nursing and it opens the pathway for further study as well as professional development. The paper is called N777 and looks at specific conditions within populations relating to my work environment. It involves assignments, a verbal presentation and a clinical examination.”,
	,
	When Lennaa completes her 12 month work contract she hopes to continue at Whangarei Hospital to gain more experience, but ultimately she would like to travel. “I’m only 22 and there is so much I want to see, learn and experience. The NorthTec Nursing Degree is fantastic because it is a highly regarded internationally recognized qualification.”,
	,
	“I’d like to do a Post Graduate Diploma in Nursing through Auckland University by correspondence while I am working. I think it is important to be a life time learner and keep abreast with advances and changes within the nursing profession.”,
	,
	Lennaa feels her NorthTec training has set her up for unlimited options for her future. “Eventually, I want to travel and work and I’m excited about what possibilities may open up. Choosing to study at NorthTec meant I had the convenience of living at home and enjoying the great beaches and environment of Northland. I was also able to work part time and keep up with friends and family here. Plus, I’m not starting my career with a huge student loan.”,
	,
	“The NorthTec tutors were all fantastic - particularly in their level of support. They were committed, passionate and were readily available to guide us. During the last year the focus was on preparing us for work. This included preparing us for interviews and learning how to present ourselves confidently and professionally.”,
	,
	Now Lennaa is settling into her new job and looking towards her future. “I’m keen to learn, gain experience, soak up knowledge and take advantage of each and every learning opportunity.”,

 All applicants must have a level of English sufficient to be able to study at this level. Applicants for whom English is not a first language must have an IELTS Academic score of 6.5 with no band score lower than 6.5 or an accepted international equivalence.  
 
All applicants must also: 

 
	 
	 Provide evidence of good character and personal attributes: 

	 
		 
		 A personal statement that outlines why they have chosen nursing as a career and describe personal qualities and relevant aspects from their life experiences which will enhance the application. 
		 
		 
		 Two referee reports that outline appropriateness to study in the nursing profession. 
		 
	 
	 
	 
	 Authorise a Police Check for criminal convictions, including meeting the requirements of the Children’s Act 2014, and disclose any pending charges.

	 Have an immune status commensurate with, or complete vaccinations required by NZ health workers and in line with the policies of contracted clinical workplaces prior to any clinical placement. 
	 
 

 Police Check Requirement 

 You are involved in a variety of clinical placements. Each successful applicant is therefore required to complete and return a NZ Police Consent to Disclosure of Information form with their application. Your completed form in the Enrolment Form Pack will be sent by NorthTec to the  Police Licensing and Vetting Service  and returned in confidence to the Programme Leader. 

 Please note that access to clinical placements is subject to police vetting clearance as specified by that agency. 

 Additional Requirements 

 You must also meet the following if you are accepted into the programme:

	 have the ability to read and write unassisted (because of the requirement to independently and accurately read and write case notes and other documentation when in clinical practice). Applicants must be able to understand, interpret and speak English, at a level that is safe in clinical practice - the inability to do so would create risk or harm to others. Note that students may request, however, the use of a ‘reader/writer’ for exams in the instance of temporary disability. 
	 
 

 Selection 

 All applicants will be interviewed and where applicants exceed available places selection will be based on evidence of interest, motivation, academic achievement, referee’s reports and regional considerations (availability of clinical practice/work experience positions).

","“My Phys Ed teacher at school was my inspiration to want to teach physical education myself. Since then, it is what I have wanted to do. My other motivation is that no-one else in my family has a degree so I feel I have the opportunity here to open new horizons for my kids and my greater whānau.”,“I was already doing weights and fight-sports and am really into physical exercise so I knew this was what I wanted to do. I looked at other universities but this is the same degree with the same result and it’s right here at home.”,“One of the great things about a career in sport and recreation is doing something different every day. I’ve always been into sport, hands-on stuff, and getting out there and involved, and I came here straight from school. This course is heaps of fun with lots of time outside the classroom. It gives us plenty of experiences and opportunities and we get to apply our learning in settings out in the community – like being involved with Seka World Cup last year.”,A few years ago Vinkal started reading up on physiology and bio-mechanics to complement his own performance in running, body building and swimming, but that fascination has now led to a career change. “I have a Master’s degree in commerce and was an accountant in India, but when I started coaching other runners there as a side-line in 2010, I realised coaching was more natural for me. The students I was coaching had good successes at state and national levels so I looked at how and where to study sport and recreation.”,“I’ve always loved sport, and now I have a real passion for competitive rugby and rowing, and social squash and basketball. I lived my first 10 years here in Whangarei then lived in Wellington for intermediate school and Auckland for high school. I’ve returned here straight from school because I want to study sport and rec and I want to play rugby here.”,“I just finished my first year studying Sport and Recreation at Waikato uni when my circumstances changed. I wanted to move back up here so I took a semester off then had to start again.”,“Sport Northland is a great organisation to work for.”,
,
“I started working at Kensington Fitness in a customer services role whilst completing last year of my degree. In the final weeks of that year, an opportunity arose to step into a job as a Green Prescription support person. I was in that position for three years before moving in to Healthy Lifestyle Lead in 2017, and on to my current position as He Oranga Poutama Lead. ,
,
“Learning the content, skills, and attitudes from our Sport and Rec course, as well as my upbringing was a real match for my work here. The work experience that I got from our practical study time supported me to apply what we were learning. I continue to be challenged, learn and grow in my role here. Challenges are a big part of development and growth.”,
,
“A lot of the skills I’ve learnt through study and work are transferable to home and family. Things like time management, interpersonal communication, understanding people better and knowing how to adapt, all apply to our lives. My mahi and the opportunities it offers every day, are fulfilling.”,
	“We’re meeting a gap in the fitness market and we get results, so the business just continues to grow.” Jessica Rule runs her personal training business, Results Rule, from a remodelled shed on a rural property near Kerikeri. “Both the business and the premises have evolved but what we do is working.” To validate that, Jessica was awarded Up and Coming Personal Trainer of the Year in the New Zealand Fitness Awards for 2013.,
	“I spent most of my adult life unhealthy and overweight. I then got fit and healthy.,“During my cooperative placement for the Bachelor in Sport and Recreation programme, I managed to attain part-time employment before I graduated from my degree. I was stuck on ideas for my co-operative which, like work experience, prepares you for what to expect in a work situation and how you can best apply your knowledge.”,
,
“When I started my co-operative placement with Sport Northland I had never heard of Green Prescription. I had to increase my knowledge and understanding on the programme as well as the organization as a whole.”,
,
“I’ve always been a very shy person and coming here was initially overwhelming and intimidating for me. Studying gave me the confidence to apply the skills and information I had acquired into the workplace environment.”,
,
“The best part about studying for me was the flexibility. It allowed me to have a year off when I had my boy. Then once I was ready, I was able to continue my degree through part-time study, which better suited my circumstances.”,
,
“In August 2016 and only halfway through my studies, a part-time job came up in Green Prescription which I was fortunate to have secured. Within a month this had progressed into a full-time role!”,
,
“After a year in Green Prescription I then moved onto my current role as an Energizer in 2017.  Energize is an initiative working primarily with decile 1-4 primary and intermediate schools to improve children’s physical activity and nutrition, and ultimately to improve their overall health, while helping schools achieve their education outcomes.”,
,
“My decision to switch to a department that better reflected my passion and why in life has a lot to do with my upbringing. Growing up around multiple adverse influences was very challenging in my youth. What really empowered me through this time were the positive values displayed by role models that crossed my path during my schooling days. They really impacted on my decisions and where I wanted to take myself later in life and I honestly believe that I wouldn’t have taken this path to where I am now if it wasn’t for these people.

I had a daughter when I was 15 and was supported by a social worker, and I knew then that I wanted to work with people and support other teen dads.”,“I’m passionate about my people, te iwi Māori and Pasifika, and want to help them to identify and enhance their Mana and their potential for greatness. I have a lot of motivation to do this because I’m already working as a youth mentor for Ngapuhi Iwi Social Services.” ,“When I walked across that stage at graduation to receive my Degree in Social Services, it was the first time I had graduated at doing anything – ever. I cried tears for the first time in my life.”,“Doing my degree was the best decision I’ve ever made and now that I’m working in the field I’m even more driven to make a difference.”,
	“It’s great to be helping strengthen community again. This is the future. I see my work as more about community development than Social Services,” says Ligi Pakieto-Johnstone, recent Bachelor of Applied Social Services graduate from NorthTec. “Families are taking their power back now so there is not so much agency in their lives. In my new job as co-ordinator at Onerahi Resource Centre I can help enable this.”,
	,
	After a four year learning journey, Ligi has returned to work amongst the community she grew up in.  “Two years of my training was in the Community Development stream at Unitec in Auckland. This introduced me to different models of community and gave me a lens to look further than the individual. Then my Mum was seriously ill so I returned to the north to be near her. I did the next two years of my study up here at NorthTec with the focus on the individual and I finished at the end of 2013.”,
	,
	During her study, Ligi was juggling her learning with working up to fourteen hours a day. “At some stage I was working seven hours of paid work at Te Puna a Te Aroha (Maori Women’s Refuge) and then seven hours at Te Ora Hou (an organization that works with youth at risk) as part of my practicum. I still wonder how I did it. I know it wouldn’t have been possible without the support of my husband and my children. The journey has simply unfolded and I could never have been better prepared than by being on the path I have been on. This includes my Mum’s passing.”,
	,
	“I was also in the first year of roll-out of the Enquiry Action Learning (EAL) delivery of the NorthTec Social Services degree programme. I’m a kinaesthetic learner so it was perfect for me. We did group-led projects with the lecturer becoming more of a facilitator, and together we chose pathways which worked best for different scenarios. We had to learn to be team players while dealing with the dynamics of personality. We became like family as we learnt together. In those two years, I also developed my networks so my fellow students have now become my colleagues.”,
	,
	Ligi’s new job came up before she even finished her degree. “This position came up in my final few weeks of study. I applied and got it. I grew up in this community and my family has been part of it for over seventy years, so it offered a great chance to give back. I love the job.”,
	,
	Ligi especially loves working with people from different walks of life. “There are priceless moments most days and we are all learning every day. The challenge is to avoid taking over or becoming the expert. The people we work with are the experts on their own lives. By us working collaboratively and consultatively, they hold the power in their own lives. They simply need to see some different modelling and get a bit of guidance. The community I work with is my boss and I like that.”,
	Ligi’s own family has been inspired by her learning. “I am the first woman in our whole whakapapa to study and succeed in tertiary education. My daughter has mimicked my modelling and will graduate as a teacher next year. The possibilities are wide open now to all our next generations.”,

	“I was born at the change of tide and at the time, my grandmother said to my mother that I therefore had the capacity to change our whakapapa. I feel I have made that change by showing the power of education and knowledge. I feel I’ll be in this job back home in my own community for quite a while and I still volunteer for a day a week at hospice where I utilize the time to take me closer to my Mum.”,

By being here, I’m weaving myself back to my true life. I was born into this. My mother excelled at weaving and it was always a part of my life, like breathing. But I took it for granted.”,“I began my pathway for weaving in 2002 and I’m humbled that I’m able to share my journey alongside the high calibre of people of Maunga Kura Toi (Maori Creative Arts).

	“I tossed up between studying architecture or business management here and chose business management because it applies to any industry and can be used in any country.”,
	,
	But it took Gina seven years to get her degree in applied Business Management. “I did two years full time then went out and got some real world experience. I walked the street and knocked on doors and someone offered me work as a junior in an accountancy office simply because I did that. They paid for my studies and gave me time off so that I could stairs-step from the certificate to other diploma, to the degree.”,
	,
	Learning isn’t easy for Gina. “I am dyslexic so I have to really put in the hours. I was home-schooled and then did correspondence so even sitting in a classroom was a new experience for me. Initially I started with the degree but I freaked out so went back and started at certificate level. The tutors here were very very helpful. They liked me because I worked hard and they got me lots of extra help.”,
	,
	After Gina completed her degree she continued to study part time until she became Certified Practising Accountant (CPA). She now works as a senior accountant with a local firm. “Accountancy is a highly sought after skill with a broad application, so getting my degree has given me the security that my skills will always be relevant. I am now broadening my experience, and ultimately I’d like to be a partner in an accounting firm.”,
	,
	Gina highly recommends that people get some real life experience before settling into study. “It makes what you’re learning real and gives your student life more balance.”,

There are additional costs associated with membership of the Project Management Institute and for those who wish to sit the PMI professional examinations.,Applicants under 20 years of age require a minimum of NCEA Level 3 with University Entrance.,Bachelor of Applied Management which may be endorsed with a major:,“My initial thought about studying was that the finish line was getting a degree, but now that I’m here at NorthTec, it has broadened my perspective on how useful what you learn can be. I was working full-time then moved into part time work in the public sector to align with my studies.”,“I’ve always been good at numbers, I like problem solving, and took an accounting paper at school. My choices were chemical engineering at Waikato or accounting here. I chose accounting here because it’s local – so I still get to ride my horse - and because friends of my parents did the same course and recommended it.”,“I have a broad range of interests and I want to start my own business so I need more skills to do that. My Dad is a business man so I’ve grown up with that awareness and I love that business management skills can apply to any industry.”,“I’ve already started a business as my ‘big industry’ project in this last year of my degree. Studying here has given me the building blocks for that and the confidence to begin.”,“I was involved in middle management and could see flaws at the higher levels but without the relevant knowledge, I couldn’t affect any change, so I started my study in Applied Management.”,“My personal circumstances changed and I decided that if I still wanted to enjoy my life and achieve all I wanted to, I had to take charge of it. I am a qualified chef but hospitality is a very hard industry to achieve a balance between work/life especially as a mother. Business allows me to have that balance, still keep the involvement of people/community, and be there for my boys. This is why I love it!”,“I’m Client Assistant here at Perpetual Guardian and I love the flexibility of the role. It includes client and staff communication and analysis of data. I chose the Project Management option for my degree and that choice seemed a positive point of interest at my job interviews.”,“After 20 years in the banking industry I wanted a change. I was concerned that I didn’t have a degree so was more susceptible to the ebb and flow of the tides of employment. We have a young family so I wanted to secure their future, plus I made a decision to move away from the corporate world. We sold a house in Auckland which enabled funding for me to do the degree.”,
 ,
Aaron Hooper was surprised at how easy the tutors made it for him as a mature student to re-enter study. “The processes were so streamlined and the tutors are so accessible and passionate about their subject.”,
 ,
They can also be challenging. Aaron - “They challenged us sometimes to change our way of thinking. As part of the course we had to audit a small business. This forced us out of our comfort zone because we had to create new relationships and networks which were part of building our future.”,
 ,
Aaron completed his Bachelor of Applied Management in 2014 and is now a Partner at MAQ Chartered Accounting. “What we learned is very practical in terms of everyday business use. I’m directly applying the financial accounting, management, and taxation that we studied.”,
 ,
“I was 39 when I started my study so my career path has been different from most. I’ve learnt that we’re never too old to change, to learn, and to progress. Don’t let age ever become a barrier.”,

,Find out more about NorthTec's Applied Management programmes,“Nearly everyone needs an accountant, so my Applied Management degree has opened a world of opportunity for me.” Nardus arrived in Whangarei at age 14 from South Africa and has wanted to be an accountant since high school. “My Mum was an accountant but this training has introduced me to a broader skill set than I expected.”,“I chose to study at NorthTec because I wanted to study locally, get the degree I had always wanted, meet Northland people and get back into my community. Studying at NorthTec for me achieved that and more. I just really loved it and had brilliant tutors who continue to support me even after I have left.”,“I did my degree in business management at a university in the Philippines and had worked in the same office job there since then. I was ready for a change, was keen to upskill, and I saw New Zealand as a good opportunity, so applied to the NorthTec international campus in Auckland. I’ve just completed my Graduate Diploma in Business which will be forever on my CV now.”,“The reason I did the business study was to get validity and pay equality for the business experience I already had, plus I wanted to get more into management. I previously had a strong background in business and accounting. I had been a PA for a power company, we had a security business, my parents ran a skating rink, and I now work full time for a business in town. Getting the business qualifications gave recognition and value to that experience.”,“When I did well at the admin and technology course in Kerikeri a few years ago, the tutor suggested I enrol for the longest and hardest course going – the Bachelor of Applied Management. So I did. It was a push for me but it was great and has landed me this wonderful job at PKF in Kerikeri.”,“I needed a high IELTS score to get accepted for degree study at NorthTec through a Chinese University that has a partnership with NorthTec. I got a high score so was accepted even though I was not yet 17 years old then. I was keen to become an accountant because I was good at maths and my Mum had trained me to be independent, so I enrolled for the Bachelor of Applied Management majoring in accountancy.”,
	“I tossed up between studying architecture or business management here and chose business management because it applies to any industry and can be used in any country.”,
	,
	But it took Gina seven years to get her degree in applied Business Management. “I did two years full time then went out and got some real world experience. I walked the street and knocked on doors and someone offered me work as a junior in an accountancy office simply because I did that. They paid for my studies and gave me time off so that I could stairs-step from the certificate to other diploma, to the degree.”,
	,
	Learning isn’t easy for Gina. “I am dyslexic so I have to really put in the hours. I was home-schooled and then did correspondence so even sitting in a classroom was a new experience for me. Initially I started with the degree but I freaked out so went back and started at certificate level. The tutors here were very very helpful. They liked me because I worked hard and they got me lots of extra help.”,
	,
	After Gina completed her degree she continued to study part time until she became Certified Practising Accountant (CPA). She now works as a senior accountant with a local firm. “Accountancy is a highly sought after skill with a broad application, so getting my degree has given me the security that my skills will always be relevant. I am now broadening my experience, and ultimately I’d like to be a partner in an accounting firm.”,
	,
	Gina highly recommends that people get some real life experience before settling into study. “It makes what you’re learning real and gives your student life more balance.”,

I’m more eager than I thought. ”,“I got the chance to be part of the service crew at NorthTec for the International Rally of Whangarei.

I love cars, so when I heard I could do an intro automotive course two days a week last year while I was still at school, I was in. One of my friends signed me up for this next level course and it’s turned out to be one of the best years of my life.”,“I wanted to change jobs because the gardening and tree trimming I’d been doing was getting too hard on my body. I was used to fixing my own mowers and machinery so I looked on the internet and found this automotive course close to home. I had moved to Kaikohe from Auckland because I could afford to buy my own house here.”,“For the last couple of years I’ve been buying cheap cars, fixing them up and selling them online or to my mates but there are gaps in my knowledge. I’m learning so much here that I wish I’d started the course sooner.”,“I didn’t know much about automotive engineering but I was keen to learn. Before I started the course I brought my CV in here to Keith Andrews Trucks and they suggested I do the NorthTec pre-trade course. I loved it because I was hungry to learn and went into it with a fresh mind.”,“I grew up around trucks because my Dad was a panel-beater and I knew I wanted to go into the automotive industry but not in panel-beating. I’ve had a link here at Keith Andrews Trucks as part of our high school Gateway Programme automotive option where I had a placement here for a day a week for four weeks. I spoke with the workshop manager and he suggested I do the NorthTec pre-trade course, then come back and apply for an apprenticeship. All the new apprentices here have done that course.”,

She painted to express herself and I used to go around and paint with her. I loved it and I could see how much better she felt through the painting process. I also worked at a primary school helping kids with disabilities to form alphabet letters.”,Budding artist Brody Laurenson was able to sign up for a degree programme after successfully completing the level 4 certificate in arts and design.,“When I was four I wanted to be a physiotherapist. I did science and health all through school thinking I wanted to be a nurse, then I started nursing and realised it wasn’t for me! I was stressing too much.”,“I love the idea of Whangarei becoming a creative community so I want to encourage all of us to invest our skills here and to help that grow. The Hundertwasser centre can serve as a catalyst for our new and expanded city identity.”,“I’ve wanted to study art since loving it at school but I went into hospitality then I realized it wasn’t quite it for me. My Dad is great at art and it’s in our family line. I wanted to make it more than a hobby in my life. Taking out a student loan was a big commitment step, plus I live 45 minutes away so I catch a bus down here three days a week.”,Working with flowers isn’t what Jacinta imagined she would be doing when she studied for her visual arts degree. “I majored in photography but in my last year at NorthTec my body of work was looking at how women are perceived in art. Flowers are often used as symbols of women, and that seeded my interest in flowers.”,“My degree has already landed me a good job in digital arts in Auckland - and a surprise award at graduation.” Joshua won the NorthTec Council Art Award which included a cheque for $1000. “It was a complete surprise to me but it may be because I put in a lot of effort and filled up about eight books with drawings, theory and coding. I’m passionate about digital arts.”,“I decided to do my degree at NorthTec because when it came to choosing a country to study in from India, the best options were New Zealand or Italy. I didn’t want to learn another language so I chose New Zealand, and of all the places I applied to, NorthTec was the first to respond. It’s been a great choice.”  ,With majors in either visual or digital arts, this degree gives you the opportunity to explore a wide variety of approaches and techniques in the fields of drawing, intermedia, sculpture, ceramics, printmaking, photography, graphic design and digital arts.","Year 1 – Core Courses,
